### Missing Codex CLI chat error

#### Feature/Change Name
Fresh installs without a runnable Codex CLI show a visible chat runtime error.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Start the app in an isolated environment without `codex` in `PATH` and without `CODES_CODEX_COMMAND`.
2. Use a mobile viewport such as `390x844`.
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher when the app can reach settings.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the app home/new chat screen.
2. Confirm the composer area shows `Codex CLI not found. Install @openai/codex or set CODES_CODEX_COMMAND.`
3. Confirm the model dropdown no longer fails silently as the only visible symptom.
4. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-3.

#### Expected Results
- The missing CLI condition is visible in the chat/composer area.
- The banner remains readable and does not overlap the mobile composer controls.
- Dark theme uses a dark error surface, not a light-theme panel.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop and remove the isolated container or test server.

### Startup avoids duplicate setup probes

#### Feature/Change Name
Startup loads Git repository status only for the active thread/new-thread cwd or an opened project menu, shares workspace-root state reads, and returns free-mode status without waiting on OpenRouter model discovery.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. Browser runtime profiler available (`pnpm run profile:browser`)
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, run `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 pnpm run profile:browser`.
2. Inspect the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*.json`.
3. Confirm startup does not call `/codex-api/git/repository-status` once per visible project.
4. Confirm startup performs at most one `/codex-api/workspace-roots-state` GET before user actions.
5. Confirm `/codex-api/free-mode/status` completes without waiting for a live `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` request.
6. Open a thread and confirm at most the selected thread cwd is checked with `/codex-api/git/repository-status`.
7. Open the project action menu for several projects and confirm Git-backed actions still appear only for Git repositories after each menu-specific status check.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-7.

#### Expected Results
- Initial sidebar Git status hydration does not scan every visible project.
- The `/codex-api/git/repository-status/batch` endpoint is not used.
- Git status checks are lazy and scoped to the active thread/new-thread cwd or the project menu being opened.
- App startup and initial thread loading share workspace-root state loading instead of issuing duplicate startup reads.
- Free-mode status returns cached or fallback model options immediately and refreshes model discovery in the background.
- Git-backed project menu actions remain correct in light theme and dark theme.
- Free-mode controls remain readable and functional in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*` artifacts if they are not needed for comparison evidence.

### CLI password output redaction

#### Feature/Change Name
CLI startup output no longer prints the configured password or embeds it in the tunnel URL.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Project dependencies are installed.
2. CLI build is available from the current branch.

#### Steps
1. Run `pnpm run build:cli`.
2. Start the CLI with a disposable password: `node dist-cli/index.js --no-tunnel --no-open --port 5998 --password TEST_SECRET_SHOULD_NOT_PRINT`.
3. Confirm startup output includes the local and network URLs.
4. Confirm startup output does not include `Password:` or `TEST_SECRET_SHOULD_NOT_PRINT`.
5. Start the CLI without an explicit password and confirm startup output prints `Generated password file:` with a path under `$CODEX_HOME`.
6. Confirm the generated password file exists, is readable by the current user, and has `0600` permissions.
7. If tunnel testing is available, start with tunnel enabled and confirm the printed tunnel URL and QR code do not include `/password=`.

#### Expected Results
- Password-protected startup still works.
- The password is not printed as a standalone line.
- Auto-generated passwords remain discoverable through the generated password file path.
- Tunnel output does not include an autologin URL containing the password.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the disposable CLI process.

### npx run dev compatibility shim

#### Feature/Change Name
The accidental `npx run dev` command starts the repository dev wrapper instead of failing with a missing `dev` module.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Run from the repository root.
2. Local dependencies are available, or the dev wrapper can install them with `pnpm install`.
3. Port 5173 is free, or Vite can select the next available port.

#### Steps
1. Run `npx run dev`.
2. Confirm the command reaches the existing `scripts/dev.cjs` wrapper and starts Vite.
3. Stop the dev server with Ctrl-C.
4. Repeat with `npx run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.

#### Expected Results
- `npx run dev` no longer fails with `Cannot find module '<repo>/dev'`.
- The command starts the same dev server path as `npm run dev` / `pnpm run dev`.
- Host and port arguments are passed through to Vite.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop any dev server process started for validation.

### Feature: Dark theme for worktree runtime selector and Skills Hub

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.
- Skills Hub route is accessible.

#### Steps
1. Open the home/new-thread screen and inspect the `Local project / New worktree` runtime selector trigger.
2. Open the runtime selector and verify menu title, options, selected state, and checkmark visibility in dark mode.
3. Trigger a worktree action that shows worktree status and verify running/error status blocks remain readable in dark mode.
4. Open `Skills Hub` and verify header/subtitle, search bar, search/sort buttons, sync panel, badges, and status text.
5. Verify at least one skill card surface (title, owner, description, date, browse icon) in dark mode.
6. Open a skill detail modal and verify panel, title/owner, close button, README/body text, and footer actions in dark mode.

#### Expected Results
- Runtime dropdown trigger and menu use dark backgrounds, borders, and readable text/icons.
- Worktree status blocks use dark-friendly contrast for both running and error states.
- Skills Hub controls and sync panel are fully dark-themed with consistent hover/active states.
- Skill cards and the skill detail modal render with dark theme colors and accessible contrast.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset appearance to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Deferred ancillary startup refreshes

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one large existing thread is available in the sidebar.
- Browser runtime profiler can run with Playwright from this repository.

#### Steps
1. Open a large thread route directly, for example `#/thread/<thread-id>`.
2. Confirm the thread message history appears before non-critical metadata finishes refreshing.
3. Run `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_ROUTE="#/thread/<thread-id>" PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 node scripts/profile-browser-runtime.cjs`.
4. Open the generated JSON report under `output/playwright/`.
5. Inspect `slowestApiRows` and `duplicateCounts`.

#### Expected Results
- The selected thread uses exactly one `thread/resume` and zero `thread/read` calls during initial load.
- Direct thread route hydration has one owner and does not trigger duplicate selected-thread message loads from route watchers.
- Thread history loading is not blocked by waiting for `skills/list`, `account/rateLimits/read`, or `collaborationMode/list`.
- Skills, model metadata, rate limits, and collaboration modes still populate shortly after the thread is visible.
- The profiler report has no duplicate-load warnings.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*` artifacts if they are not needed for comparison evidence.

### Feature: Runtime selector uses a toggle-style control

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.

#### Steps
1. On the home/new-thread screen, locate the runtime control below `Choose folder`.
2. Verify both options (`Local project` and `New worktree`) are visible at once without opening a menu.
3. Click `New worktree` and confirm it becomes the selected option style.
4. Click `Local project` and confirm selection returns.
5. Set Appearance to `Dark` in Settings and verify selected/unselected contrast remains readable.

#### Expected Results
- Runtime mode is presented as a two-option toggle (segmented control), not a dropdown menu.
- Clicking each option immediately switches the selected state.
- Selected option has a distinct active background/border in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Leave runtime mode and appearance at the previous user preference.

### Feature: Dark theme states for runtime mode toggle

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.

#### Steps
1. Locate the runtime mode toggle (`Local project` and `New worktree`) under `Choose folder`.
2. Hover each option and verify hover state is visible against dark backgrounds.
3. Select `New worktree`, then select `Local project` and compare active/inactive contrast.
4. Tab to the toggle options with keyboard navigation and verify the focus ring is visible.
5. Confirm icon color remains readable for selected and unselected options.

#### Expected Results
- Toggle container, options, and text/icons use dark-friendly colors.
- Hover and selected states are clearly distinguishable in dark mode.
- Keyboard focus ring is visible and does not blend into the background.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Return appearance and runtime selection to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Sandbox approval requests recognize newer Codex payloads

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository with a Codex CLI/app-server version that can request approvals.
- `bubblewrap` is installed so sandboxed command approvals can be triggered.
- Approval policy is set to request approval on sandbox escalation.

#### Steps
1. Start a thread and ask Codex to run a command that requires approval outside the current sandbox.
2. Wait for the pending request panel to appear.
3. Confirm the request is shown as an approval prompt, not the generic fallback with `Return Empty Result` and `Reject Request`.
4. Verify the panel offers approval choices (`Yes`, `Yes for Session`, decline text field, `Skip`).
5. If the approval payload includes a command preview or writable root, verify that preview text is shown in the panel.

#### Expected Results
- Sandbox-related approval requests are classified as approvals even when Codex sends newer method or payload variants.
- The approval UI offers normal approval actions instead of the unknown-request fallback buttons.
- The request stays attached to the correct thread rather than only appearing as a global pending request.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Decline or skip the pending approval request after verification.

### Feature: pnpm dev script installs dependencies and starts Vite

### Feature: Tailscale CIDRs bypass password and Cloudflare tunnel is opt-in

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository via CLI.
- A Tailscale client can reach the host over Tailscale IPv4 (`100.64.0.0/10`) or IPv6 (`fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`).
- `cloudflared` is installed only if testing `--tunnel`.

#### Steps
1. Start CLI without tunnel flag: `npx codes --port 5900`.
2. From a Tailscale client, open `http://100.x.x.x:5900` using a host address in `100.64.0.0/10` (replace with host tailnet IP).
3. Confirm the app opens directly without the password login page.
4. (Optional IPv6 check) Open the same service using the host Tailscale IPv6 address in `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48` and confirm it also bypasses password.
5. Stop the server and start again with tunnel enabled: `npx codes --port 5900 --tunnel`.
6. Confirm startup output now includes a `Tunnel:` URL only when `--tunnel` is provided.
7. Stop and restart once more without `--tunnel`, and verify no tunnel URL is printed.

#### Expected Results
- Requests from Tailscale IPv4 `100.64.0.0/10` are treated as trusted and do not require password sign-in.
- Requests from Tailscale IPv6 `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48` are treated as trusted and do not require password sign-in.
- Cloudflare tunnel does not start by default.
- Cloudflare tunnel starts only when `--tunnel` is explicitly passed.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the CLI process.
- If a cloudflared tunnel was started, ensure the tunnel child process has exited.

### Feature: Tunnel auto mode follows Tailscale IP detection

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository via CLI.
- One environment with detected Tailscale IP (`100.64.0.0/10` or `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`) and one without (or simulated by disabling Tailscale).

#### Steps
1. Start server without explicit tunnel flags: `npx codes --port 5900`.
2. In a host where Tailscale IP is detected, verify startup output includes `Tunnel:`.
3. In a host where Tailscale IP is not detected, verify startup output does not include `Tunnel:`.
4. Start server with explicit override `--no-tunnel` and verify no `Tunnel:` output even when Tailscale IP is present.
5. Start server with explicit override `--tunnel` and verify `Tunnel:` output even when Tailscale IP is not present.

#### Expected Results
- Without explicit flags, tunnel enablement follows Tailscale IP detection.
- `--no-tunnel` always disables tunnel startup.
- `--tunnel` always enables tunnel startup.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the CLI process after each verification run.
- Ensure cloudflared child process exits after shutdown.

### Feature: Reverse tunnel login is required unless request is trusted local or Tailscale

#### Prerequisites
- App is running with password enabled.
- One direct local browser session (`localhost`).
- One reverse tunnel path (for example SSH/Cloudflare forwarding) that reaches the same server.
- Optional Tailscale client in `100.64.0.0/10` or `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`.

#### Steps
1. Open app via `http://localhost:<port>` and confirm it opens without login when request is true local loopback.
2. Open app via reverse-tunnel URL and confirm login page is shown.
3. Enter correct password in reverse-tunnel URL and confirm session cookie allows access.
4. (Optional) Open app via Tailscale IP and confirm login is bypassed.

#### Expected Results
- Local loopback access is allowed without login prompt.
- Reverse-tunnel access does not bypass auth and requires password.
- Valid login on reverse-tunnel path creates session and grants access.
- Tailscale CIDR requests remain trusted.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear browser cookies for the app origin(s).
- Stop the CLI process.

### Feature: Cloudflare tunnel QR omits password auto-login path

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository with password enabled.
- Cloudflare tunnel startup is enabled (`--tunnel` or auto-enabled path).

#### Steps
1. Start CLI and wait for tunnel output.
2. Verify the printed `Tunnel:` URL does not include a `/password=` suffix.
3. Scan the terminal QR code from a phone/browser.
4. Confirm first page load shows the password form when no trusted bypass applies.
5. Use the generated password file path from startup output to retrieve the password and sign in.

#### Expected Results
- Tunnel URL shown in startup output does not expose the password.
- QR code encodes the base tunnel URL without a password-bearing path.
- The generated password remains available from the local password file.
- Base tunnel URL requires login when no trusted bypass applies.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the CLI process.
- Clear cookies for the tunnel origin if needed.

### Feature: No automatic restore of last active thread on startup

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one existing thread is available.
- Browser local storage is enabled.

#### Steps
1. Open the app in a regular browser tab (`http://localhost:<port>/`), select any thread, then navigate back to home route (`#/`).
2. Refresh the browser tab.
3. Confirm the app remains on home route and does not auto-switch to `#/thread/:threadId`.
4. Install/open the app in PWA standalone mode, select any thread, navigate to `#/`, and relaunch the PWA.

#### Expected Results
- In regular browser-tab mode, startup does not restore and redirect to the last active thread.
- In PWA standalone mode, startup also does not restore and redirect to the last active thread.
- Existing `openProjectPath` startup behavior still opens the requested project on home.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear app local storage state if you need to reset startup behavior for retesting.

#### Prerequisites
- `pnpm` is installed globally (`npm i -g pnpm` or via corepack).
- Repository is cloned and `node_modules/` does not exist (or may be stale).

#### Steps
1. Remove `node_modules/` if present: `rm -rf node_modules`.
2. Run `pnpm run dev`.
3. Wait for Vite dev server to start and display the local URL.
4. Open the displayed URL in a browser.

#### Expected Results
- `pnpm install` runs automatically before Vite starts (dependencies are installed).
- Vite dev server starts successfully and serves the app.
- No `npm` commands are invoked.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Default runtime uses workspace-write sandbox with on-request approvals

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- No `CODES_SANDBOX_MODE` or `CODES_APPROVAL_POLICY` environment overrides are set for the launch shell.

#### Steps
1. Start the app normally from this repository without passing `--sandbox-mode` or `--approval-policy`.
2. Open the startup logs or terminal output and find the runtime summary.
3. Confirm the reported sandbox mode is `workspace-write`.
4. Confirm the reported approval policy is `on-request`.
5. Restart the app with explicit overrides, for example `--sandbox-mode danger-full-access --approval-policy never`, and confirm those override the defaults.
6. With those overrides still active, trigger an account flow that uses the temporary app-server path (for example a quota/account inspection request).
7. Confirm the temporary app-server request succeeds under the active override settings and does not behave as if it were still using the original startup defaults.

#### Expected Results
- Default launch uses `workspace-write` sandbox mode.
- Default launch uses `on-request` approval policy.
- Explicit CLI flags still override the defaults when provided.
- Temporary app-server spawns in account routes use the current env-derived runtime args, including CLI overrides.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any temporary CLI overrides before leaving the environment.

### Feature: Windows npx install no longer depends on legacy PTY package

#### Prerequisites
- A Windows machine with Node.js and npm installed.
- No globally installed `codes` package.
- Clear any previous temporary npm cache for `codes` if needed.

#### Steps
1. Run `npx codes --no-login` on Windows.
2. Confirm npm does not print deprecation warnings for `prebuild-install`, `npmlog`, `are-we-there-yet`, or `gauge` during package install.
3. Exit the app, then run `npx codes --no-login` again.
4. Run `npm i -g codes` on Windows.
5. Start the globally installed CLI with `codes --no-login`.
6. On macOS or Linux, start the app normally and confirm the integrated terminal still opens in a thread.
7. Repeat the integrated terminal check in both light theme and dark theme.

#### Expected Results
- Windows `npx` install no longer pulls `node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch` as a required install dependency.
- The deprecated `prebuild-install` dependency chain warnings no longer appear for `codes` installation.
- Re-running `npx codes --no-login` works without getting stuck in the same failed temporary install loop.
- Global installation succeeds on Windows.
- Integrated terminal continues to work through `node-pty` on supported hosts.
- Light theme and dark theme terminal surfaces remain readable and unchanged.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the global package with `npm rm -g codes` if it was installed only for verification.

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread can run a long response (for example, request a large code explanation).

#### Steps
1. Send a prompt that keeps the assistant generating for several seconds.
2. Immediately click the `Stop` button before the first assistant chunk fully completes.
3. Confirm generation halts.
4. Repeat with a resumed/existing in-progress thread (reload app while a turn is running, then click `Stop`).

#### Expected Results
- No error appears saying `turn/interrupt requires turnId`.
- Turn is interrupted successfully in both immediate-stop and resumed-thread scenarios.
- Thread state exits in-progress and the stop control returns to idle.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Startup sync preserves local skill edits when remote is ahead

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured to a private GitHub fork.
- Local skills repo has a tracked edit in an existing skill file.
- Remote `main` has at least one newer commit than local (simulate from another machine or commit directly on GitHub).

#### Steps
1. Edit a local skill file (for example update description text in `SKILL.md`) and keep the change.
2. Trigger `Startup Sync` in Skills Hub.
3. If a non-fast-forward condition exists, allow startup sync to complete retry path.
4. Re-open the same local skill file and verify your edit remains.
5. Trigger `Force Refresh Skills` and verify no unexpected skill removals occurred.

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync no longer fails with non-fast-forward push due to missing remote integration.
- Local tracked skill edits remain after sync (not overwritten by remote state).
- Sync path rebases/pulls with autostash and auto-resolves conflicts by mtime policy:
  - choose remote (`theirs`) when remote file commit time is newer than local file mtime.
  - choose local (`ours`) otherwise.
- No manual conflict intervention is required during startup sync retries.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert test-only skill text changes if they were not intended to keep.

### Feature: Startup sync conflict fallback when one side is missing

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync repo contains a conflict candidate where only one side exists for a path (for example delete/modify scenario).
- Skills Hub is accessible.

#### Steps
1. Open `Skills Hub`.
2. Click `Startup Sync`.
3. Wait for sync completion or error toast.
4. Verify no toast/error contains `does not have our version`.

#### Expected Results
- Sync conflict resolver handles missing `--ours`/`--theirs` versions safely.
- Startup sync does not fail with `git checkout --ours/--theirs` missing-version errors.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Startup sync does not delete remote AGENTS.md

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured to `friuns2/codexskills`.
- Remote `main` contains `AGENTS.md`.
- Local skills repo is clean before startup sync.

#### Steps
1. Confirm remote `AGENTS.md` exists on `main`.
2. Confirm local `~/.codex/skills` is clean.
3. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. After completion, inspect latest commit created by sync (if any).
5. Verify `AGENTS.md` still exists locally and in remote `origin/main`.

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync may update manifest, but must not delete `AGENTS.md`.
- If sync creates a commit, changed files do not include `D AGENTS.md`.
- Local and remote `AGENTS.md` hashes remain equal after sync.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Bidirectional AGENTS.md sync via Startup Sync

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured to `friuns2/codexskills`.
- `~/.codex/skills` is a clean git working tree before each sub-test.
- Skills Hub startup sync endpoint is reachable.

#### Steps
1. Remote -> Local:
2. Add a unique marker to remote `AGENTS.md` on `main`.
3. Confirm local `HEAD` is behind `origin/main`.
4. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
5. Verify local `AGENTS.md` contains the remote marker and local `HEAD == origin/main`.
6. Local -> Remote:
7. Add a different unique marker to local `~/.codex/skills/AGENTS.md`.
8. Confirm local working tree shows `M AGENTS.md`.
9. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
10. Verify remote `origin/main:AGENTS.md` contains the local marker and local `HEAD == origin/main`.

#### Expected Results
- Remote-only AGENTS edits are pulled into local without deletion.
- Local AGENTS edits are pushed to remote after startup sync.
- After each sync direction, local and remote commit SHAs match.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary test markers from `AGENTS.md` if required.

### Feature: Mixed local+remote AGENTS edits do not stall Startup Sync

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured and working.
- Local skills repo clean before test start.

#### Steps
1. Add marker `A` to remote `AGENTS.md`.
2. Add marker `B` to local `AGENTS.md` before syncing.
3. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. Wait for startup status to finish (`inProgress=false`).
5. Verify sync outcome explicitly:
6. If sync succeeds, local/remote SHAs match and expected merged marker result is present.
7. If sync fails, status includes a concrete error message (not silent success).

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync must not report success while local remains behind remote.
- No stale stash side-effects are introduced (no unexpected conflict from old stash entries).
- Final state is either a valid synchronized result or an explicit failure status with actionable error.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset local skills repo to `origin/main` after test if needed.

### Feature: Startup sync uses deterministic pull reconcile (`fetch + reset --hard`) before local replay

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync is logged in and targets `friuns2/codexskills`.
- Local repo path is `~/.codex/skills`.
- Startup Sync endpoint is reachable at `/codex-api/skills-sync/startup-sync`.

#### Steps
1. Remote-only case:
2. Commit a unique marker to remote `AGENTS.md` on `main`.
3. Ensure local repo is clean and reset to `origin/main`, then trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. Confirm marker appears locally and `HEAD == origin/main`.
5. Local-only case:
6. Add a unique local marker to `~/.codex/skills/AGENTS.md` (uncommitted), trigger `Startup Sync`.
7. Confirm marker is pushed and `HEAD == origin/main` with clean worktree.
8. Mixed case:
9. Add local marker first, then commit a newer remote marker.
10. Trigger `Startup Sync` and verify mtime policy result (newer remote marker wins, older local marker dropped).
11. Confirm final state is clean with `HEAD == origin/main`.

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync does not fail with missing merge refs (`MERGE_HEAD`/`REBASE_HEAD`) in this path.
- Remote-only changes are always pulled first and visible locally.
- Local-only changes are preserved and pushed during the same startup sync run.
- Mixed local+remote edits converge automatically with no manual conflict handling.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary test markers from `AGENTS.md` if not needed.

### Feature: Default runtime uses unrestricted sandbox and no approvals

#### Prerequisites
- Build artifacts are available (or run directly from source in this repo).
- No `CODES_SANDBOX_MODE` or `CODES_APPROVAL_POLICY` environment variables are exported in the shell.

#### Steps
1. Start the app from this repository without passing `--sandbox-mode` or `--approval-policy`.
2. Observe startup logs for the printed runtime config lines.
3. Confirm the logs show `Codex sandbox: danger-full-access` and `Approval policy: never`.
4. Stop the app and restart with explicit overrides, for example `--sandbox-mode workspace-write --approval-policy on-request`.
5. Confirm startup logs now show the override values.

#### Expected Results
- Default startup (no flags/env) uses `danger-full-access` sandbox and `never` approval policy.
- Explicit CLI overrides still take precedence and are applied correctly.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Unset any temporary env vars used for override checks.

### Feature: npm run dev exports unrestricted runtime defaults

#### Prerequisites
- Node and pnpm are installed.
- No shell-level `CODES_SANDBOX_MODE` or `CODES_APPROVAL_POLICY` overrides are set.

#### Steps
1. Run `npm run dev` from the repository root.
2. In a second terminal, run `ps eww -p $(pgrep -f "vite" | head -n 1)`.
3. Confirm the process environment contains `CODES_SANDBOX_MODE=danger-full-access` and `CODES_APPROVAL_POLICY=never`.
4. Stop dev server and run `CODES_SANDBOX_MODE=workspace-write CODES_APPROVAL_POLICY=on-request npm run dev`.
5. Re-check the Vite process environment values.

#### Expected Results
- Default `npm run dev` includes `CODES_SANDBOX_MODE=danger-full-access` and `CODES_APPROVAL_POLICY=never`.
- Explicit shell overrides still take precedence when provided.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop running dev servers and unset temporary env overrides.

### Feature: Approval request uses legacy in-conversation request card only

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open a thread where Codex can trigger an approval request (for example a command or file-change approval).

#### Steps
1. Trigger an approval request in an existing thread.
2. Observe the conversation timeline where server requests are rendered.
3. Observe the composer area at the bottom of the thread.
4. Confirm the approval controls are shown in the in-conversation request card.
5. Confirm no separate composer waiting-state approval panel is rendered.

#### Expected Results
- Exactly one approval UI is visible for the active pending request.
- The approval UI appears in the conversation request card.
- Composer continues to show the standard composer UI without a separate approval panel.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: CLI auto-stars friuns2/codes on startup (best-effort)

#### Prerequisites
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- Start the app via CLI from this repository (`pnpm run dev` or published `npx codes`).

#### Steps
1. Ensure the repository is not starred (optional baseline): `gh api /user/starred/friuns2/codes --silent --include` and check status code.
2. Launch `codes` CLI once.
3. After startup, run: `gh api /user/starred/friuns2/codes --silent --include`.
4. Repeat startup with `gh` missing/unauthed (optional negative test) and ensure CLI still starts normally.

#### Expected Results
- On startup, CLI sends a non-blocking star request for `friuns2/codes` with ~1% probability (1/100 launches).
- When `gh` is available and authenticated, repository ends up starred.
- If `gh` is unavailable or fails, startup continues without crash.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Unstar if needed: `gh api -X DELETE /user/starred/friuns2/codes`.

### Feature: CLI no longer requires codex login on startup

#### Prerequisites
- Remove `~/.codex/auth.json` to simulate a first-time user.

#### Steps
1. Run `npx codes` or `pnpm run dev`.
2. Verify the CLI prints a message about not being logged in but does NOT block or prompt for login.
3. Verify the server starts and the web UI loads successfully.
4. Use the Provider dropdown in settings to select OpenRouter and start chatting without a Codex account.

#### Expected Results
- CLI does not run `codex login` on startup.
- A friendly message is shown: "You can log in later via settings or run `codes login`."
- The app is fully usable without a Codex account when using OpenRouter or custom providers.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Run `codes login` to restore Codex authentication if needed.

### Codex CLI + OpenCode Zen Big Pickle Model

#### Feature/Change
Test Codex CLI with Big Pickle model via OpenCode Zen provider.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Codex CLI v0.93.0 installed (`npm install -g @openai/codex@0.93.0`) - this version supports `wire_api = "chat"` which Big Pickle requires.
2. OpenCode CLI v1.4.3+ installed (`npm install -g opencode`).
3. OpenCode Zen API key set as env var: `export OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="sk-..."`
4. Config in `~/.codex/config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [model_providers.opencode-zen]
   name = "OpenCode Zen"
   base_url = "https://opencode.ai/zen/v1"
   env_key = "OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY"
   wire_api = "chat"

   [profiles.pickle]
   model = "big-pickle"
   model_provider = "opencode-zen"
   ```
5. OpenCode config in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
     "model": "opencode/big-pickle",
     "provider": {
       "opencode": {
         "options": {
           "apiKey": "sk-..."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

#### Step-by-Step Actions

**Test 1: Codex CLI with Big Pickle (profile)**
1. `export OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="sk-..."`
2. `echo "say hi" | codex exec --profile pickle`
3. Expect: Big Pickle responds with a greeting. Shows `provider: opencode-zen` in header.

**Test 2: Codex CLI with inline config**
1. `echo "say hi" | OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="sk-..." codex exec -m "big-pickle" -c 'model_provider="opencode-zen"'`
2. Expect: Same response.

**Test 3: OpenCode CLI with Big Pickle**
1. `echo "" | opencode run --pure "say hi"`
2. Expect: Big Pickle responds with a greeting.

**Test 4: Direct API verification**
1. `curl -s -X POST "https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/chat/completions" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." -d '{"model":"big-pickle","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}],"max_tokens":100}'`
2. Expect: JSON response with `choices[0].message.content` containing a greeting.

#### Expected Results
- Big Pickle model responds via chat completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`).
- Big Pickle is free during beta period.
- Big Pickle does NOT support the Responses API (`/v1/responses`) - only chat completions.
- Codex CLI v0.118+ will NOT work with Big Pickle (removed `wire_api = "chat"` support).
- Codex CLI v0.93.0 works with `wire_api = "chat"`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- To restore latest Codex CLI: `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest`
- Remove `[model_providers.opencode-zen]` and `[profiles.pickle]` from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Remove API key from environment.

### env_key Authentication for Custom Providers (codex CLI v0.93.0)

#### Feature/Change
Use `env_key` instead of `experimental_bearer_token` for API key injection when spawning the codex `app-server` subprocess. API keys are passed as environment variables to the subprocess rather than CLI config arguments.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
- codex CLI v0.93.0 installed
- Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
- OpenCode Zen API key: any valid key from opencode.ai

#### Step-by-Step Actions

**Test 1: OpenCode Zen with big-pickle model**
1. Open Settings, select "OpenCode Zen" provider
2. Enter a valid API key, save
3. In the model dropdown, select `big-pickle`
4. Type "say SUCCESSTEST in one word" and click Send
5. Wait for response (typically 3-5 seconds)
6. Verify: AI responds with "SUCCESSTEST"

**Test 2: Verify env var is set on subprocess**
1. After step 1-2 above, run: `ps -p $(pgrep -f "codex app-server" | tail -1) -E | tr ' ' '\n' | grep OPENCODE`
2. Verify: `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY=sk-...` appears in the process environment

**Test 3: Model mismatch causes 401 (expected)**
1. With OpenCode Zen provider active, select a paid model like `gpt-5.4-mini`
2. Send a message
3. Verify: 401 Unauthorized error appears (OpenCode Zen returns 401 for paid models without billing)
4. Switch to `big-pickle` and retry — should succeed

**Test 4: wire_api deprecation awareness**
1. Run: `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="<key>" codex -c 'model_providers.oz.wire_api="chat"' -c 'model_providers.oz.base_url="https://opencode.ai/zen/v1"' -c 'model_providers.oz.env_key="OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY"' -c 'model_provider="oz"' -m big-pickle exec "say hi"`
2. Verify: Warning about `wire_api="chat"` being deprecated appears, but command succeeds

#### Expected Results
- API key is passed via `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY` env var (not `experimental_bearer_token`)
- `big-pickle` model works and returns responses
- Paid models return 401 (billing-related, not auth-related)
- `wire_api="chat"` still works but shows deprecation warning

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider back to "Codex"
- No permanent changes to `~/.codex/config.toml`

### Zen Proxy Port Resolution When Vite Auto-Increments

#### Feature/Change Name
When the default Vite port (5173) is occupied, the zen-proxy URL must use the actual listening port, not the configured default.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Another process already occupying port 5173
2. Dev server started (will auto-bind to 5174 or next available)
3. OpenCode Zen provider configured with API key

#### Steps
1. Start any process on port 5173 (e.g., another dev server)
2. Run `pnpm run dev` — Vite auto-binds to 5174
3. Open the app at `http://localhost:5174`
4. Switch to "OpenCode Zen" provider, enter API key, save
5. Send a message using big-pickle or any OpenCode Zen model

#### Expected Results
- The zen-proxy request goes to `http://127.0.0.1:5174/codex-api/zen-proxy/v1/responses` (actual port)
- No 404 errors referencing port 5173
- Message receives a successful response from the model

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the extra process on port 5173 if it was started for testing

### Startup welcome log uses repository GitHub URL

#### Feature/Change Name
Remove the legacy npm package reference from the startup welcome log and point users to the upstream GitHub repository.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Run the app from this repository.

#### Steps
1. Start the app (for example via `pnpm run dev`).
2. Open the browser devtools console.
3. Locate the startup welcome message.

#### Expected Results
- The welcome log points to `https://github.com/friuns2/CodeS`.
- The welcome log does not contain the legacy npm package URL.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Home route no longer crashes on dev startup

#### Feature/Change Name
Keep the home route mount path working in dev mode.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Run the app from this repository with `npm run dev`.

#### Steps
1. Open `http://localhost:5173/#/`.
2. Wait for the app shell to finish loading.
3. Open the browser devtools console.

#### Expected Results
- The home screen renders instead of a black screen.
- The console does not show an app setup `ReferenceError` during initial mount.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Thread list startup pagination and direct older-thread links

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread loading uses a smaller initial list page, hydrates later pages in the background, and direct thread URLs are not rejected just because the thread is outside the first page.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Browser dev tools Network panel open
3. More than 50 existing threads, including a valid older thread outside the first updated page

#### Steps
1. Open the app home route
2. Inspect the first `thread/list` RPC request
3. Keep the app open and watch subsequent `thread/list` RPC requests
4. Open `/thread/<older-thread-id>` directly for a valid thread outside the first page

#### Expected Results
- The first `thread/list` request uses a smaller initial limit instead of 100
- Later thread pages load in the background using `nextCursor`
- The sidebar gains older threads as background pages complete
- The direct older thread URL stays on the thread route and loads messages instead of redirecting home

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Browser runtime profiling with Playwright

#### Feature/Change Name
Playwright browser runtime profiler captures route timing, Codex API network counts, screenshots, and trace files.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Dependencies installed (`pnpm install`)
3. Target route available, such as `#/thread/019da7c0-4e12-7a91-837c-f7c11cc8ab6c`

#### Steps
1. Run `pnpm run profile:browser`
2. Run `PROFILE_ROUTE='#/thread/019da7c0-4e12-7a91-837c-f7c11cc8ab6c' pnpm run profile:browser`
3. Inspect console output for duplicate counts and slowest API rows
4. Open the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*.json`
5. Open the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*-trace.zip` with `npx playwright show-trace`

#### Expected Results
- The profiler prints final URL, title, total observed time, duplicate request counts, and slowest Codex API calls
- JSON report includes raw API rows, grouped summaries, Performance API data, and artifact paths
- JSON report includes `pageState.stillLoadingThreads`; the profiler exits non-zero if the page still contains `Loading threads...` after the thread-loading timeout
- Screenshot is saved under `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*.png`
- Trace is saved under `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*-trace.zip`

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete generated files under `output/playwright/` if local artifacts are no longer needed

---

### Skills tab npx skills search

#### Feature/Change Name
The Skills tab includes a registry search panel backed by `npx skills find`, shows matching skill cards, and installs selected registry results with `npx skills add`.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Network access available for `npx skills find`
3. `npx` can run the published `skills` package
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/skills`
2. Verify the `Skills` tab is selected by default; open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/skills?tab=plugins`, then click `Skills` and verify the URL updates to `?tab=skills`
3. Verify the `Find skills` header shows a `Skills directory` link on the right that opens `https://skills.anyclaw.store/` in a new tab
4. In `Find skills`, type a query such as `browser`
5. Click `Search`
6. Verify the app calls `/codex-api/skills-hub/search?q=browser`, which runs `npx --yes skills find browser`
7. Verify `Search results (count)` appears above `Installed skills (count)`
8. Verify each registry result card shows its install count metadata, such as `1.2K installs`, even when a GitHub `SKILL.md` description is shown
9. Open one GitHub-backed result and verify the detail modal shows the skill name, owner/repository, parsed `SKILL.md` description, GitHub-backed icon/avatar, and external link
10. Click `Install` for a result and verify the backend runs `npx --yes skills add <owner/repo@skill> --yes --global`
11. After install, verify the result becomes installed and the installed skills list refreshes from local installed skill data rather than appending the remote registry card
12. Switch to dark theme and repeat the search visibility check
13. Search for an already-installed skill and verify its search result shows `Installed`
14. Verify installed matches in search results keep their remote registry owner/details while showing the `Installed` badge
15. Open the installed search result and verify the modal reads the local installed `SKILL.md`, exposes `Uninstall`, and does not show the registry install flow
16. Open a local-only installed skill and verify the modal does not show a dead `View on GitHub` link when no external URL is available
17. Verify cards in the `Installed skills (count)` section do not show `Installed`, `Disabled`, or repeated `local` owner labels, while search result cards can still show installed state and registry owner details
18. Verify installed cards show local `SKILL.md` descriptions when the installed skill has frontmatter or readable markdown content
19. Verify Find skills result cards do not show the local folder browse icon; Browse files remains available inside the installed local modal

#### Expected Results
- Search results are parsed from the real `npx skills find` output, not a static catalog
- Skills search/install commands use the repo command invocation wrapper so `npx` starts reliably on Windows
- Skills search/install commands include outer `npx --yes` so first-run package prompts cannot hang with ignored stdin
- The Skills directory link is visible beside Find skills in light and dark theme and opens the public directory in a new tab
- Registry installs run noninteractively with `--yes --global`, so the process cannot stop at the agent-selection prompt and falsely report success
- Registry install responses only return `ok: true` when the local installed `SKILL.md` path is found and validates successfully
- The UI treats a missing returned path or missing post-refresh local skill as an install failure instead of showing the remote registry card as installed
- GitHub-backed results fetch the repository `SKILL.md` and show its `description` frontmatter when available, falling back to the install count when unavailable
- GitHub metadata enrichment is bounded to the first 20 results with limited concurrency, so broad searches still return without unbounded raw GitHub fetch fanout
- Search result cards keep the registry install count visible as card metadata even when GitHub enrichment replaces the fallback description
- GitHub-backed results show an explicit frontmatter `icon` when provided, otherwise they show the GitHub repository owner avatar instead of a generic letter fallback
- The search UI does not replace or hide local installed skills
- Installed matching results show the existing `Installed` badge and can be opened like local skills
- Installed detection uses the same installed skills source as the Skills Hub list, including RPC/plugin/shared skills and not only the base skills directory
- Installed search result cards keep remote registry ownership/content but include local installed state and path for actions
- Newly installed registry results are reloaded from the local installed skills source before appearing in the Installed skills section
- Opening an installed search result uses the local installed skill record/path, so local content, uninstall, enable/disable, browse, and try actions behave the same as the Installed skills section
- Local-only installed skills hide the external GitHub link when no URL is available
- Installed skills section cards hide redundant installed/disabled status labels
- Installed skills section cards hide the repeated local owner label; registry search cards keep owner/repository labels to distinguish remote results
- Installed skill descriptions come from the local installed `SKILL.md`, so installed cards are useful without opening each modal
- Installed entries are assembled concurrently so reading local `SKILL.md` descriptions does not add one file-read round trip per installed skill
- Opening or switching to the Skills tab lists MCP servers without forcing an MCP reload; the top-level Refresh button remains the explicit reload action
- The top-level Refresh button only shows `Refreshing...` for explicit user-triggered refreshes, not for ordinary initial tab loading
- Find skills cards hide local folder browse actions to avoid mixing remote registry cards with local-only card controls
- Light theme and dark theme keep the search panel, cards, and modal readable

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Uninstall any skill installed only for this test

---

### Accounts panel Codex login callback modal

#### Feature/Change Name
Accounts settings includes an always-available `Login` button that starts `codex login`, opens the returned authorization URL, shows an in-app callback modal, requests the pasted localhost callback URL from the server, and imports the completed Codex account.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. `codex` CLI available in the server process `PATH`
3. Browser can open the authorization URL returned by the server
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. Open settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. In light theme, verify `Login` appears even when an active account is already listed.
3. Click `Login`.
4. Verify a new tab opens to the OpenAI authorization URL and an in-app `Complete Codex login` modal asks for the localhost callback URL.
5. Complete authorization in the browser until it redirects to a `http://localhost:<port>/auth/callback?...` URL.
6. Paste that full localhost callback URL into the modal input and click `Complete`.
7. Verify the account list refreshes, the new or refreshed account is active, and normal thread/account data reloads.
8. Click `Login` again, close the modal, and verify the Accounts panel keeps the `Open login URL` fallback link available.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-4, verifying the Login button, link, modal, input, and buttons have readable contrast.

#### Expected Results
- `Login` is available regardless of current login state.
- Starting login runs `codex login` on the server and exposes the generated OpenAI authorization URL.
- Completing login uses the modal input value, only accepts local callback URLs, and uses the server to request the pasted callback.
- After completion, `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` is imported into the Accounts list and selected as the active account.
- Completion does not remain stuck waiting for the `codex login` process after the callback has updated `auth.json`.
- Light-theme and dark-theme controls are readable and do not overlap.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any test-only account from the Accounts panel if needed.
- If a login is abandoned, restart the dev server to clear any in-memory pending login process.

### Fresh Docker mobile install does not show rate-limit request failures

#### Feature/Change Name
Fresh unauthenticated install mobile home screen rate-limit handling.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Docker is available.
2. A clean container has this project installed under `/workspace`.
3. `@openai/codex` is installed in the container.
4. Container dev server is running with a fresh Codex home:
   `CODEX_HOME=/tmp/codex-home CODES_CODEX_COMMAND=$(command -v codex) pnpm run dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173`
5. The container port is mapped to the host, for example `127.0.0.1:4174 -> 4173`.

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4174/` in a mobile viewport such as iPhone 13 `390x664`.
2. In light theme, wait for the Start new thread home screen to render.
3. Capture network responses and confirm no `/codex-api/rpc` response fails with `502` for `account/rateLimits/read`.
4. Confirm the composer renders and the quota UI is simply absent when the fresh `CODEX_HOME` has no authenticated Codex account.
5. Switch to dark theme and reload the same mobile viewport.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 4 in dark theme.
7. Add an `auth.json` containing only `tokens.access_token` and confirm `account/rateLimits/read` is not short-circuited as unauthenticated.
8. Replace `auth.json` with malformed JSON and confirm the server logs a `[codex-auth] Unable to read Codex auth state` warning while the home screen still renders.

#### Expected Results
- The fresh mobile home screen renders without a blank page.
- `account/rateLimits/read` returns an empty result instead of a `502` when no Codex account is authenticated.
- An access-token-only auth file is treated as authenticated enough to ask Codex for rate limits.
- Malformed auth files are visible in server logs instead of being silently treated as a normal fresh install.
- The UI remains usable in light theme and dark theme.
- No login or account import is required just to load the home screen.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop and remove the temporary Docker container, for example `docker rm -f <container-name>`.

### PWA 安装窗口标题栏主题色

#### Feature/Change Name
安装为 App 后，浏览器 PWA 标题栏使用与页面一致的浅色/深色背景。

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. 开发服务器已运行：`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`
2. 使用支持安装页面为 App 的 Chromium 浏览器打开 `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`
3. 如已安装旧版 App，先关闭旧窗口并从浏览器重新打开或重新安装，避免旧 manifest 缓存影响观察。

#### Steps
1. 在普通浏览器窗口打开页面，确认 `<meta name="theme-color">` 初始在浅色系统下为白色，在深色系统下为 `#1e1e1e`。
2. 点击浏览器的 Install page as app / 安装应用入口，打开 standalone App 窗口。
3. 在应用侧边栏设置中切换到浅色主题。
4. 确认安装 App 的标题栏/窗口顶栏不是黑色，而是与页面浅色背景一致的白色。
5. 在应用侧边栏设置中切换到深色主题。
6. 确认标题栏/窗口顶栏变为与页面深色背景一致的 `#1e1e1e`，不是纯黑色。
7. 切换到 System 主题，并改变系统浅色/深色外观，确认应用重新聚焦或系统偏好变化后标题栏跟随系统主题。

#### Expected Results
- 浅色主题下，PWA 标题栏使用白色，与页面主背景连续。
- 深色主题下，PWA 标题栏使用 `#1e1e1e`，与页面深色背景连续。
- System 模式下，标题栏跟随系统浅色/深色偏好变化。
- manifest 默认颜色不再把安装 App 固定为黑色标题栏。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 如果测试时安装了 PWA App，可在浏览器应用管理页卸载测试实例。
- 如果测试时修改了主题偏好，将 `codex-web-local.dark-mode.v1` 恢复为 `system` 或删除。

### Maintenance: Centralized env helpers and CLI tunnel module

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js and pnpm are installed.
- No shell-level `CODES_*` or legacy `CODEXUI_*` overrides are required.

#### Steps
1. Run `pnpm run build`.
2. Run `pnpm run test:unit`.
3. Run `node dist-cli/index.js --help` after build.
4. Start dev with default env: `npm run dev`.
5. In another shell, inspect the Vite process env and confirm `CODES_SANDBOX_MODE`, `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE`, `CODES_APPROVAL_POLICY`, and `CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY` are set consistently.
6. Stop dev, then run with legacy overrides: `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE=workspace-write CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY=on-request npm run dev`.
7. Confirm the app still starts and runtime config resolves the legacy values through the centralized helper.
8. Start CLI with `node dist-cli/index.js --no-open --no-tunnel --no-login --no-password --port 4173` and confirm normal startup output.

#### Expected Results
- Build and unit tests pass.
- CLI help loads without module resolution errors.
- `scripts/dev.cjs` writes both current and legacy runtime env keys.
- Runtime config accepts current `CODES_*` keys and legacy `CODEXUI_*` keys.
- Tunnel behavior remains available through the extracted CLI tunnel module when enabled.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop any dev or CLI server processes started during verification.
- Unset temporary runtime env overrides.
