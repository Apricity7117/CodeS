### Composer controls stay editable during responses

#### Feature/Change Name
Model, skill, thinking, and plan controls remain usable while a thread turn is in progress.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. A thread that can produce a long enough response to interact with the composer while the assistant is responding
3. At least one installed skill or saved prompt
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, send a message that starts an assistant response.
2. While the response is still streaming, type a follow-up draft in the composer.
3. Open the model dropdown and select a different model.
4. Open the skills dropdown and select a skill or saved prompt.
5. Open the thinking dropdown and select a different value.
6. Open the attachment menu and toggle plan mode.
7. Verify the stop button and send/queue behavior still match the in-progress turn state.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1 through 7.

#### Expected Results
- The message textarea remains editable while the assistant is responding.
- Model, skills, thinking, and plan controls are not disabled during the in-progress response.
- Selected controls update the composer state for the next submitted or queued message.
- Stop remains available while no draft content is present, and the submit button switches to the configured steer/queue behavior when draft content exists.
- Light-theme and dark-theme controls remain readable and do not overlap.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any disposable queued messages or test skill selections from the thread.

### Feature: Import 10 working DB accounts and keep Accounts section collapsed by default

#### Prerequisites
- Have a SQLite DB with `account_tokens.refresh_token` rows (default path: `/Users/igor/Git-projects/any-auto-register/account_manager.db`).
- Network access available for token exchange against OpenAI OAuth endpoint.
- Codex home available at `~/.codex` (or set `CODEX_HOME`).
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).

#### Steps
1. Run `scripts/import-working-accounts-from-db.sh`.
2. Verify script reports `imported` rows and ends with `done imported=<n>` where `n <= 10`.
3. Open `~/.codex/accounts.json` and verify new account entries were appended/updated.
4. Verify snapshot files exist under `~/.codex/accounts/<sha256(account_id)>/auth.json`.
5. Open app settings and check the `Accounts` section is collapsed on first load.
6. Click the chevron toggle in Accounts header to expand.
7. Confirm account list/error/empty state renders correctly after expanding.
8. Reload the page and confirm collapsed/expanded state persists.

#### Expected Results
- Script imports up to 10 valid (token-exchange-successful) accounts and skips invalid tokens.
- `accounts.json` and per-account snapshot `auth.json` files are created with secure file modes.
- Accounts panel in settings is collapsed by default when no saved preference exists.
- User can expand/collapse Accounts via header toggle, and the state persists in localStorage.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove imported snapshots from `~/.codex/accounts/` and corresponding rows in `~/.codex/accounts.json` if needed.
- Delete localStorage key `codex-web-local.accounts-section-collapsed.v1` to reset UI preference.

### Feature: Accounts no longer stuck on "Fetching account details…"

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have at least one imported account in the Accounts section.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. Ensure at least one account has no immediately available quota snapshot (for example right after import/refresh, or by waiting for quota read failure).
3. Observe the quota/status line for that account after the initial fetch completes.
4. Trigger `Reload` in the Accounts header and wait for account list update.
5. Re-check accounts that are not in `Loading quota…` state.

#### Expected Results
- `Fetching account details…` appears only while the entry is truly in transient loading.
- Accounts that are not loading and still have no quota snapshot show `Quota unavailable` instead of a perpetual fetching label.
- Existing `Loading quota…` and explicit error messages continue to render correctly.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Account quota background refresh recovers from stale loading and inspection hangs

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have multiple imported accounts in `~/.codex/accounts.json`.
- At least one account previously left with `quotaStatus: "loading"` for longer than 2 minutes, or one account that causes quota inspection to hang.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. Trigger account list refresh by loading the page or clicking `Reload`.
3. Monitor `~/.codex/accounts.json` and confirm stale `loading` accounts are re-picked for refresh (not ignored indefinitely).
4. Wait at least 30 seconds when one account is slow/hanging.
5. Verify other accounts continue progressing instead of all remaining blocked.
6. Re-open the Accounts section and inspect final status labels for previously stuck accounts.

#### Expected Results
- `loading` states older than 2 minutes are retried automatically.
- A single hanging account inspection times out (about 25 seconds) and transitions to `error` rather than blocking the whole queue forever.
- Remaining accounts continue refreshing to `ready` as data becomes available.
- UI no longer stays indefinitely stuck waiting on one blocked account refresh.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Account quota label uses primary snapshot when windowMinutes is missing

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have accounts where `quotaSnapshot.primary` exists but `windowMinutes` can be null.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. Click `Reload` and wait for account statuses to settle to `ready`.
3. Inspect account rows that previously showed `Quota unavailable` while backend had `quotaSnapshot.primary.usedPercent`.
4. Verify displayed quota labels in UI and account card titles.

#### Expected Results
- Accounts with `quotaSnapshot.primary` show a remaining-percent quota label.
- `Quota unavailable` appears only when there is truly no usable quota snapshot data.
- Team/free accounts both render quota labels consistently when primary snapshot is present.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Sentry error tracking and encrypted auth context

#### Prerequisites
- Sentry project `node-express` in org `dfv-p0` accessible.
- Valid `~/.codex/auth.json` with `tokens.account_id` and `tokens.access_token`.
- Project built: `pnpm run build:cli`.

#### Steps
1. Start the CLI: `node dist-cli/index.js --no-tunnel --no-open --no-login`.
2. Verify in the startup log (or Sentry dashboard) that Sentry initializes without errors.
3. Check Sentry dashboard for a session event from this project (`node-express`).
4. Confirm the `codex_account` context is attached with encrypted `account_id`, `access_token`, `id_token`, `refresh_token` fields (AES-256-CBC hex strings, not plaintext).
5. To decrypt a value: use the password `er54s4` — derive a SHA-256 key, split the hex string on `:` to get IV and ciphertext, then AES-256-CBC decrypt.

#### Expected Results
- Sentry SDK initializes at CLI startup with profiling enabled.
- `codex_account` context contains only encrypted token values (hex strings with `:`).
- No plaintext tokens appear in Sentry events.
- CLI startup is not blocked or slowed noticeably by Sentry init.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `@sentry/node` and `@sentry/profiling-node` from `package.json` and delete `src/cli/instrument.ts` to fully revert.

### Free Mode (OpenRouter)

#### Feature
Toggle "Free mode" in settings to use free OpenRouter models without an OpenAI API key. Uses XOR-encrypted community keys that rotate randomly per request. Default model is `openrouter/free` — OpenRouter's meta-model that auto-routes to the least-loaded free model, avoiding per-model rate limits. Model selector shows only free models when free mode is on. Config is isolated from `~/.codex/config.toml` — state stored in `~/.codex/webui-free-mode.json` and passed to app-server via `-c` CLI args.

#### Prerequisites
- Project built: `pnpm run build`.
- Codex CLI installed and available in PATH.

#### Steps
1. Start the server: `node dist-cli/index.js --no-tunnel --no-open --no-login`.
2. Open the UI in a browser (default `http://localhost:5999`).
3. Open the sidebar settings panel (gear icon).
4. Toggle **Free mode (OpenRouter)** ON.
5. Verify the toggle turns on and model dropdown changes to `openrouter/free`.
6. Click the model dropdown — verify it shows **only** free models (gemma, llama, qwen, etc.) and no GPT/OpenAI default models.
7. Verify `~/.codex/config.toml` was NOT modified (no `model_provider` or `model` entries added).
8. Verify `~/.codex/webui-free-mode.json` exists and contains `{"enabled":true,"apiKey":"sk-or-v1-...","model":"openrouter/free"}`.
9. Open a new thread and send a message (e.g. "Say hello").
10. Verify a response comes back from a free OpenRouter model (may be rate-limited during high demand).
11. Toggle **Free mode (OpenRouter)** OFF.
12. Verify the model dropdown reverts to GPT-5.3-codex (or default OpenAI model).
13. Verify model dropdown shows normal OpenAI models (not free models).

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /codex-api/free-mode` — body `{ "enable": true/false }` — toggles free mode, restarts app-server.
- `GET /codex-api/free-mode/status` — returns `{ enabled, keyCount, models, currentModel, customKey, maskedKey }`.
- `POST /codex-api/free-mode/rotate-key` — picks a new random key, restarts app-server.
- `POST /codex-api/free-mode/custom-key` — body `{ "key": "sk-or-v1-..." }` — sets a custom OpenRouter API key. Send empty string to revert to community keys.
- `GET /codex-api/provider-models` — returns `{ data: [...], exclusive: true }` when free mode is on (only free models shown).

#### Custom API Key
- When free mode is ON, an "OpenRouter API key" input appears below the toggle in settings.
- Enter your own `sk-or-v1-...` key and click "Set" (or press Enter) to use your own OpenRouter key.
- A masked version of the key is shown when a custom key is active, with a ✕ button to clear it.
- Clearing the custom key reverts to community keys.

#### Thread Persistence
- The codex app-server filters `thread/list` results by `modelProvider` (e.g. `openai` vs `openrouter-free`).
- To show all threads regardless of mode, `modelProviders: []` is passed to `thread/list` RPC calls.
- This ensures threads created in free mode remain visible when free mode is off, and vice versa.
- Toggling free mode ON/OFF preserves all threads — no data is lost.
- Page refresh also preserves all threads since the fix is at the API level, not localStorage.

#### Known Limitations
- `wire_api="chat"` is not supported by the codex CLI — must use `wire_api="responses"`.
- Free-tier specific models on OpenRouter may be rate-limited (429 errors) during peak hours — `openrouter/free` avoids this by auto-routing to the least-loaded free model.

#### Expected Results
- Free mode ON: App-server is restarted with `-c` config args for openrouter-free provider. Model selector shows only free models.
- Free mode OFF: App-server is restarted without free mode args. Model selector shows default models.
- `~/.codex/config.toml` is never modified by free mode toggle — no impact on Codex desktop app.
- 68 encrypted keys available, decrypted at runtime with XOR key `er54s4`.
- Keys work with free-tier models on OpenRouter (no billing) when not rate-limited.
- Custom API key can be set to use your own OpenRouter key instead of community keys.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `src/server/freeMode.ts`, revert changes in `codexAppServerBridge.ts`, `codexGateway.ts`, and `App.vue`.
- Delete `~/.codex/webui-free-mode.json` to clear free mode state.

### Feature: Provider dropdown in settings (replaces free mode toggle)

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).

#### Steps
1. Open Settings panel from the sidebar.
2. Verify the settings panel is scrollable when content overflows.
3. Verify the Accounts section does NOT have its own scrollbar — it flows naturally within the settings panel scroll.
4. Locate the **Provider** dropdown (default: "Codex").
5. Change provider to **OpenRouter**.
6. Verify a "Get API key" link appears next to the OpenRouter API key label, pointing to `https://openrouter.ai/keys`.
7. Verify the API key input field is shown with placeholder `sk-or-v1-... (optional, uses free keys if empty)`.
8. Optionally enter an OpenRouter API key and click Set.
9. Change provider to **Custom endpoint**.
10. Verify URL and API key input fields appear.
11. Enter a valid endpoint URL and click Save.
12. Change provider back to **Codex**.
13. Verify the config is reset and no provider-specific fields are shown.

#### Expected Results
- Provider dropdown shows three options: Codex, OpenRouter, Custom endpoint.
- Selecting OpenRouter enables free mode with community keys (or custom key if provided).
- Selecting Custom endpoint allows setting a custom API base URL and bearer token.
- Selecting Codex disables external provider mode and uses the default Codex backend.
- Settings panel scrolls as a whole; accounts section has no independent scrollbar.
- OpenRouter option includes a "Get API key" link to openrouter.ai/keys.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider back to Codex to restore default behavior.

### OpenCode Zen Provider & Wire API Selector in codes

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenCode Zen as built-in provider + API format selector for custom endpoints

#### Step-by-Step Actions

**Test 1: Select OpenCode Zen provider**
1. Open the app in browser
2. Click the provider dropdown in the sidebar settings
3. Select "OpenCode Zen"
4. Verify: An API key input field appears with "Get API key" link
5. Enter a valid OpenCode Zen API key (sk-...)
6. Click "Save"
7. Verify: Provider is saved, model list fetches from OpenCode Zen `/models` endpoint
8. Send a message — it should use `wire_api = "chat"` (Chat Completions API)

**Test 2: Select Custom endpoint with API format selector**
1. Select "Custom endpoint" from the provider dropdown
2. Enter a custom base URL (e.g., `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`)
3. Enter an API key
4. Verify: An "API format" dropdown appears with "Responses API" (default) and "Chat Completions"
5. Select "Chat Completions"
6. Click "Save"
7. Verify: Provider is saved with `wireApi = "chat"`
8. Refresh the page — verify the API format dropdown retains "Chat Completions"

**Test 3: Provider persistence**
1. Select "OpenCode Zen", enter key, save
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify: Provider dropdown shows "OpenCode Zen" (not "Codex" or "OpenRouter")

**Test 4: Switch back to Codex**
1. From OpenCode Zen, select "Codex" provider
2. Verify: Free mode is disabled, standard Codex flow resumes

#### Expected Results
- OpenCode Zen appears in provider dropdown alongside Codex/OpenRouter/Custom
- OpenCode Zen defaults to `wire_api = "chat"` (Chat Completions API)
- Custom endpoints show an API format selector; default is "Responses API"
- Provider selection and wireApi are persisted in `~/.codex/webui-free-mode.json`
- Model list for OpenCode Zen is fetched from `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models`

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider back to "Codex" to disable free mode
- No config files outside the project are modified (state stored in `~/.codex/webui-free-mode.json`)

### Provider Switch Model List Isolation

#### Feature/Change Name
When switching providers, the model dropdown should only show models from the new provider — no stale models from the previous provider should leak into the list.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Access to at least two providers (e.g., "Codex" and "OpenRouter")

#### Steps
1. Open the app sidebar settings
2. Select "OpenRouter" provider — model list should show OpenRouter free models (e.g., `openrouter/free`, `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free`)
3. Select a model like `openrouter/free`
4. Switch provider back to "Codex"
5. Open the model dropdown

#### Expected Results
- Model list shows only Codex models (e.g., `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`)
- No OpenRouter models (e.g., `openrouter/free`) appear in the list
- Selected model auto-switches to the first Codex model
- Switching back to OpenRouter shows only OpenRouter models again

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No permanent changes needed

---

### Model List Search / Filter

#### Feature/Change Name
Search/filter input in the model selection dropdown.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Any provider configured with available models

#### Steps
1. Open any thread or new-thread view
2. Click the model selector button in the composer bar
3. Observe the search input at the top of the dropdown
4. Type a partial model name (e.g., "pickle")
5. Observe filtered results

#### Expected Results
- A text input with placeholder "Search models..." appears at the top of the dropdown
- Typing filters the model list to only matching models (case-insensitive, matches label or value)
- Clearing the search shows all models again
- Pressing Escape clears the search text first, then closes the dropdown on second press
- "No results" shown when no models match the query

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No permanent changes needed

---

### OpenRouter "hi" request should not return invalid_prompt

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenRouter provider keeps Responses API but sanitizes unsupported tool entries via local proxy so simple prompts (for example `hi`) do not fail with tool-schema validation errors.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. OpenRouter provider selected in Settings
3. Valid OpenRouter API key configured (custom key or community key)
4. Any OpenRouter model selected

#### Steps
1. Open any thread
2. Send `hi`
3. Wait for assistant output to complete
4. Check the response area for any JSON error block mentioning `invalid_prompt` or `Invalid Responses API request`

#### Expected Results
- Assistant returns a normal text reply to `hi`
- No `invalid_prompt` error JSON is shown in the message stream
- No message about invalid tool discriminator/type appears

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider back to previous setting if needed

---

### Custom Endpoint API switch shows Responses vs Completions

#### Feature/Change Name
Custom endpoint settings present an API format switch with `Responses API` and `Completions API` options.

#### Prerequisites/Setup

2. Open Settings panel
3. Select provider `Custom endpoint`

#### Steps
1. In Custom endpoint settings, locate `API format` dropdown
2. Open the dropdown
3. Verify available options
4. Select `Completions API`
5. Select `Responses API`

#### Expected Results
- Dropdown options are exactly `Responses API` and `Completions API`
- Selecting either option updates the visible selected value correctly

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Leave the preferred API format selected for your endpoint

---

### Custom Endpoint API format uses segmented toggle control

#### Feature/Change Name
Custom endpoint API format is presented as a two-button toggle (`Responses` / `Completions`) instead of a dropdown.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open Settings panel
3. Select provider `Custom endpoint`

#### Steps
1. Locate `API format` in Custom endpoint settings
2. Click `Completions`
3. Confirm the `Completions` button becomes active
4. Click `Responses`
5. Confirm the `Responses` button becomes active
6. In dark mode, verify active/inactive contrast remains readable

#### Expected Results
- API format control is a segmented two-button toggle
- Exactly two choices are available: `Responses` and `Completions`
- Active option is visually highlighted and switches immediately on click
- Control remains readable in both light and dark themes

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Keep the desired API format selected

---

### OpenRouter API format toggle (Responses vs Completions)

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenRouter settings expose a two-option API format toggle and persist the selected mode.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open Settings panel
3. Select provider `OpenRouter`
4. OpenRouter key configured (community or custom key)

#### Steps
1. In OpenRouter settings, find `API format` toggle
2. Click `Completions`
3. Send `hi` in a thread and wait for response
4. Re-open Settings and confirm `Completions` remains selected
5. Click `Responses`
6. Send `hi` again and wait for response
7. Re-open Settings and confirm `Responses` remains selected

#### Expected Results
- OpenRouter API format control is a segmented toggle with `Responses` and `Completions`
- Both modes save successfully without provider switch errors
- Sending `hi` works in both modes (assistant reply, no `invalid_prompt` error block)
- Selected mode persists in status after refresh/reload

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Leave OpenRouter on the preferred API format

---

### Provider-scoped model defaults + OpenRouter completions bash fallback

#### Feature/Change Name
Model defaults are stored per provider (no cross-provider leakage), and OpenRouter `Completions` mode preserves shell-tool execution by routing tool-capable requests through Responses compatibility.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open Settings panel
3. OpenRouter key configured

#### Steps
1. Switch provider to `OpenRouter` and choose a specific OpenRouter model in composer selector
2. Switch provider to `Codex`
3. Choose a Codex model different from the OpenRouter one
4. Switch back to `OpenRouter`
5. Verify previous OpenRouter model selection is restored
6. In OpenRouter settings, set API format to `Completions`
7. Send: `what codex cli version is? it should run bash commands`

#### Expected Results
- Provider switch restores the last model used for that provider
- OpenRouter model does not leak into Codex provider model list/selection, and vice versa
- In `Completions` mode, the assistant can still invoke bash/tool execution flow and return the CLI version result

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Set provider/model/api format back to preferred defaults

---

### Unified provider proxy: OpenRouter + OpenCode Zen tool-capable completions

#### Feature/Change Name
Both OpenRouter and OpenCode Zen routes use a unified Responses proxy layer that preserves tool-capable behavior when using Completions mode.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Valid OpenRouter and/or OpenCode Zen API keys configured
3. Existing thread open

#### Steps
1. Select `OpenRouter`, set API format to `Completions`, and send: `what codex cli version is? it should run bash commands`
2. Confirm shell execution appears and includes `codex --version`
3. Select `OpenCode Zen`, set API format to `Completions`, and send the same prompt
4. Confirm shell execution appears and includes `codex --version`
5. Repeat each provider once with simple `hi` to verify non-tool path still returns assistant text normally

#### Expected Results
- Both providers work through a common proxy path without provider-specific regressions
- In Completions mode, tool-capable prompt triggers command execution for both providers
- `codex --version` output is returned in the assistant response flow
- Simple text prompt (`hi`) continues to work in Completions mode

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/API format back to preferred defaults

### OpenCode Zen Responses Payload Normalization

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenCode Zen `Responses` mode converts Codex Responses `input` payloads to Zen-compatible `messages` payloads.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. OpenCode Zen API key configured

#### Steps
1. Open Settings
2. Set Provider to `OpenCode Zen`
3. Set API format to `Responses`
4. Save
5. Select model `trinity-large-preview-free`
6. Send `hi`
7. Switch API format to `Completions`
8. Save
9. Select model `trinity-large-preview-free`
10. Send `hi`

#### Expected Results
- `Responses` mode posts to `/zen/v1/responses` with a `messages` payload derived from Codex Responses `input`
- `trinity-large-preview-free` returns a successful assistant greeting in `Responses` mode
- `Completions` mode still posts through `/zen/v1/chat/completions` and returns a successful assistant greeting
- Models unsupported by Zen for a chosen format, such as `minimax-m2.5-free` in `Responses` mode, surface the upstream error without being hidden

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/API format back to preferred defaults

---

### Raw auth/provider error messages

#### Feature/Change Name
Surface upstream auth/provider errors without rewriting them in the client normalizer.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. A provider/backend request that can return an error

#### Steps
1. Trigger a provider/backend error, such as an auth refresh failure or invalid custom-provider response
2. Observe the surfaced error text in the UI/failed RPC path

#### Expected Results
- Error text matches the original upstream/backend error message
- No replacement copy like `Authentication session conflict detected...` is injected

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore provider/session settings to the preferred state

---

### Custom endpoint Completions via local Responses proxy

#### Feature/Change Name
Custom endpoint `Completions` mode uses a local Responses-compatible proxy so current Codex CLI versions do not reject `wire_api="chat"`.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Local OpenAI-compatible endpoint running at `http://127.0.0.1:8666/v1`
3. API key `pwd`

#### Steps
1. Open Settings
2. Set Provider to `Custom endpoint`
3. Enter Custom endpoint URL `http://127.0.0.1:8666/v1`
4. Enter API key `pwd`
5. Set API format to `Completions`
6. Save
7. Select model `claude-sonnet-4.5`
8. Send `hi`
9. Select model `glm-5`
10. Send `hi`
11. In the same thread, ask `what is latest codex cli version?`

#### Expected Results
- The Codex app-server starts with `wire_api="responses"` against `/codex-api/custom-proxy/v1`
- The custom provider save records a usable default model from `/models` when available
- The Codex app-server receives the custom default model via runtime config
- The model list preserves endpoint-advertised models, including `auto-*` aliases
- The local proxy forwards the request to `/v1/chat/completions`
- The UI renders an assistant greeting such as `Hey! How can I help you today?`
- `glm-5` returns a successful assistant response
- Follow-up tool-output turns do not fail with Kiro Gateway's generic `payload size exceeded ~615KB` error when the payload is small

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/API format back to preferred defaults

---

### ChatGPT auth tokens refresh for external auth

#### Feature/Change Name
Codex app-server `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh` requests are handled automatically from `auth.json` so expired ChatGPT access tokens can be refreshed without a manual relogin.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. App server is running from this repository
2. `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` contains ChatGPT auth with a valid `refresh_token`
3. The current ChatGPT `access_token` is expired or close enough to expiry that Codex app-server asks for token refresh

#### Steps
1. Open the app with the ChatGPT-authenticated account selected
2. Trigger an account operation such as loading account rate limits or starting a normal Codex turn
3. Watch the server logs for an `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh` server request
4. Reopen `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`
5. Repeat the same account operation after the refresh completes

#### Expected Results
- The refresh request is answered automatically and does not appear as a manual pending request in the UI
- `auth.json` is updated with the fresh `access_token` and any rotated `refresh_token` or `id_token`
- The account operation succeeds without showing `token_expired`
- If no refresh token is available, the operation fails with a sign-in-again message instead of silently looping

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None, unless a test-only `$CODEX_HOME` was used

---

### OpenCode Zen status returns current provider models

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenCode Zen free-mode status and model discovery consistency.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server or published CLI server running with no Codex auth so free mode defaults to OpenCode Zen.
2. Browser can open the home route in light theme and dark theme.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the home route.
2. Call `GET /codex-api/free-mode/status`.
3. Call `GET /codex-api/provider-models`.
4. Confirm both responses report OpenCode Zen data, including `big-pickle` and current Zen model ids such as `deepseek-v4-flash-free` when upstream returns it.
5. Confirm `/codex-api/free-mode/status` reports `wireApi` as `responses`.
6. Open the model selector immediately after initial page load and confirm the Zen models are available without first switching providers or refreshing settings.
7. In Chrome with a previously loaded app version, reload the page and confirm the service worker fetches the new script/style bundle instead of keeping stale cached selector behavior.
8. With a script/style bundle already cached by the service worker, temporarily make the same script/style request return HTTP 404 or 500 and reload.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1 through 8.

#### Expected Results
- Free-mode status does not expose stale OpenRouter cached model ids when `provider` is `opencode-zen`.
- OpenCode Zen uses `responses`, not `chat`, in saved/default UI state.
- Provider model discovery and status agree on the model list source.
- Initial startup model loading uses the active provider context and does not leave GPT-only `model/list` entries as the visible selector list for OpenCode Zen.
- Selected model ids persist to localStorage by thread/provider context; legacy/global selected-model keys cannot choose a model for OpenCode Zen, while a valid provider-scoped OpenCode Zen saved choice is restored.
- Service-worker script/style cache invalidation does not keep Chrome on an older model-selector bundle after a new local build is served.
- Service-worker script/style fetches still use a cached bundle if the network request resolves with a non-OK HTTP status.
- Model selector content remains usable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.
