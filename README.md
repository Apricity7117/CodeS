## 🤯 What Is This?
**`codes`** is a lightweight bridge that gives you a browser-accessible UI for Codex app-server workflows.

You run one command. It starts a local web server. You open it from your machine, your LAN, or wherever your setup allows.  

**TL;DR 🧠: Codex app UI, unlocked for Linux and Windows setups.**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start
> **The main event.**

```bash
# 🔓 Run instantly (recommended)
npx codes

# 🌐 Then open in browser
# http://localhost:18923
```

The CLI prints local and LAN URLs in startup output. Use the password shown in the same output when opening from another device on the same network.

If Codex is already authenticated and you do not want `codes` to force `codex login` during startup, use:

```bash
npx codes --no-login
```

### Linux 🐧
```bash
node -v   # should be 18+
npx codes
```

### Windows 🪟 (PowerShell)
```powershell
node -v   # 18+
npx codes
```

## ✨ Features
> **The payload.**

- 🚀 One-command launch with `npx codes`
- 🌍 Cross-platform support for Linux and Windows
- 🖥️ Browser-first CodeS flow on `http://localhost:18923`
- 🌐 LAN-friendly access from other devices on the same network
- 🧪 Remote/headless-friendly setup for server-based Codex usage
- ⚡ No global install required for quick experimentation
- 🎙️ Built-in hold-to-dictate voice input with transcription to composer draft
- 🧩 Local Skills Hub and composer skill picker backed by Codex local skills
- 🤖 Optional Telegram bot bridge: send messages to bot, forward into mapped thread, send assistant reply back to Telegram

### Telegram Bot Bridge (Optional)

Set these environment variables before starting `codes`:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<your-telegram-bot-token>"
export TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS="<your-telegram-user-id>,<optional-second-id>"
export TELEGRAM_DEFAULT_CWD="$PWD" # optional, defaults to current working directory
npx codes
```

`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is required for safe access. Only allowlisted Telegram user IDs can use the bridge. If no allowed user IDs are configured, incoming Telegram messages are rejected.

To find your Telegram user ID:

1. Send a message to your bot.
2. Run `curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-telegram-bot-token>/getUpdates"`.
3. Read `message.from.id` from the returned update payload.

Bot commands:

- `/start` show quick help and thread picker
- `/threads` list recent threads and pick one
- `/newthread` create and map a new Codex thread for this Telegram chat
- `/thread <threadId>` map current Telegram chat to an existing thread
- `/current` show currently connected thread for this chat
- `/history` show recent history for current thread
- `/status` show bridge/mapping status
- `/whoami` show your Telegram user/chat IDs and authorization state
- `/help` show command reference

Outgoing assistant messages are sent with Telegram `parse_mode=HTML` for formatting, with automatic plain-text fallback if HTML delivery fails.
